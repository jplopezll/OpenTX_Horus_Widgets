# OpenTX Horus Widgets

This will be my a place for new lua widgets to be developed for Taranis radios: 10, 10S, 12S...

A short description of each widget will be placed here.

# ArtHor

First attempt to make an artificial horizon to be presented as a widget on the screen. The current version already works and adapts to the size of the zone assigned.

Things to do:

- Check how to clear the area behind the widget. Flags and patterns are not working properly on the Companion.

- Link to FrSky passthrough data.
